SPIRIT1_Library 3.2.0

Changes against the previous version:
- Module SPIRIT_Radio: Power interpolation curves are now different according to the band.
 The power curve is interpolated with 3 linear curves chosen according to the PA register values.
 Extraction of these curves are based on measurements on the divisional boards.
 Accuracy is about 1.5dB.
- Module SPIRIT_Radio: Added the possibility to enable or disable the VCO calibration WorkAround at RadioInit. Added the fcn SpiritRadioVcoCalibrationWAFB for this purpose.
- Module SPIRIT_Radio: Minor bugfix in the getDatarate fcn.
- Module SPIRIT_Timers: The Rx timeout and LDC timers are now computed in a fast way that minimizes the PRESCLAER (removed the loop over all the possible values).
- Module SPIRIT_Management: the Rx workaround sets the SMPS switching frequency to 4.5MHz .
- 2 Examples added: STack_Generic and Sniff .
